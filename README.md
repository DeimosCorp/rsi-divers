## JoyID

JoyID is a great little utility that helps keep all our simulation devices (joystick, throttle, pedals, etc.) in the correct ports under Windows. This utility allows you to choose which port windows will use for each device. 

(!! Note: This tool has an effect only with games using the (old, deprecated) Win32_API for joysticks. Newer games (starting at least with IL-2 1946) probably use the DirectInput API which unfortunately ignores these IDs completely. )
